I founded **[ITERNOVA](https://www.iternova.net)** in 2004 with a colleague and friend, and after that we are developing web and mobile apps for our customers, always trying to contribute with a high degree of innovation in those systems in order to facilitate their daily work.<br/><br/>I spend my time managing projects and developing *ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems)* and infrastructure management systems (mainly for road, facility management and SmartCities, more info in **[tecnocarreteras.es](https://www.tecnocarreteras.es)** and **[iternova.net](https://www.iternova.net)**), integrating them with mobile and web applications in high availability enviroments.<br/><br/>And last, but not least, **I'm runner && time traveller since 1637**...
